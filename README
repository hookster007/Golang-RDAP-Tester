Here is how it works:

Bootstrapping: The openrdap/rdap library uses pre-defined bootstrap servers
(such as those maintained by IANA or rdap.net) to determine which is the correct,
authoritative RIR server for a given query (e.g., an ASN or IP address).


Automatic Referrals: When you initiate a query, the client library sends it to a
bootstrap server. If that server is not the authoritative source, it returns an
HTTP redirection (e.g., HTTP 301 or 302) pointing to the correct RIR's RDAP server
(e.g., ARIN, RIPE, etc.).

Library Handles the Redirects: The openrdap/rdap client is designed to follow
these redirects automatically to the authoritative server and return the final,
relevant data in a standardized JSON format.

In short, the library handles the complexity of finding the correct registry, so
your code can simply make a single logical query and receive the result from the
authoritative source without manual intervention or querying multiple RIRs.
